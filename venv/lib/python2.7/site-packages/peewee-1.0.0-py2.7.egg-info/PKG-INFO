        peewee
        ======
        
        * a small orm
        * written in python
        * provides a lightweight querying interface over sql
        * uses sql concepts when querying, like joins and where clauses
        * supports sqlite, mysql and postgresql
        * support for special extensions like `hstore <http://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#postgresql-extensions-hstore-ltree>`_ and `full-text search <http://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#full-text-search>`_
        
        For flask integration, including an admin interface and RESTful API, check
        out `flask-peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/flask-peewee/>`_.
        
        Examples::
        
            # a simple query selecting a user
            User.get(username='charles')
        
            # get the staff and super users
            editors = User.select().where(Q(is_staff=True) | Q(is_superuser=True))
        
            # get tweets by editors
            Tweet.select().where(user__in=editors)
        
            # how many active users are there?
            User.select().where(active=True).count()
        
            # paginate the user table and show me page 3 (users 41-60)
            User.select().order_by(('username', 'asc')).paginate(3, 20)
        
            # order users by number of tweets
            User.select().annotate(Tweet).order_by(('count', 'desc'))
        
            # another way of expressing the same
            User.select({
                User: ['*'],
                Tweet: [Count('id', 'count')]
            }).group_by('id').join(Tweet).order_by(('count', 'desc'))
        
        
        You can use django-style syntax to create select queries::
        
            # how many active users are there?
            User.filter(active=True).count()
        
            # get tweets by a specific user
            Tweet.filter(user__username='charlie')
        
            # get tweets by editors
            Tweet.filter(Q(user__is_staff=True) | Q(user__is_superuser=True))
        
        
        You can use python operators to create select queries::
        
            # how many active users are there?
            User.select().where(User.active == True).count()
        
            # get me all users in their thirties
            User.select().where((User.age >= 30) & (User.age < 40))
        
            # get me tweets from today by active users
            Tweet.select().join(User).where(
                (Tweet.pub_date >= today) &
                (User.active == True)
            )
        
        
        Learning more
        -------------
        
        the official `peewee cookbook <http://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/peewee/cookbook.html>`_
        has recipes for common operations and is a good place to get started.
        
        check the `documentation <http://peewee.readthedocs.org/>`_ for more
        examples.
        
        specific question?  come hang out in the #peewee channel on freenode.irc.net,
        or post to the mailing list, http://groups.google.com/group/peewee-orm
        
        lastly, peewee runs on python 2.5 or greater, though there is currently no
        support for python3
        
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        peewee began when I was working on a small app in flask and found myself writing
        lots of queries and wanting a very simple abstraction on top of the sql.  I had
        so much fun working on it that I kept adding features.  My goal has always been,
        though, to keep the implementation incredibly simple.  I've made a couple dives
        into django's orm but have never come away with a deep understanding of its
        implementation.  peewee is small enough that its my hope anyone with an interest
        in orms will be able to understand the code without too much trouble.
        
        
        model definitions and schema creation
        -------------------------------------
        
        smells like django::
        
        
            import peewee
        
            class Blog(peewee.Model):
                title = peewee.CharField()
        
                def __unicode__(self):
                    return self.title
        
            class Entry(peewee.Model):
                title = peewee.CharField(max_length=50)
                content = peewee.TextField()
                pub_date = peewee.DateTimeField()
                blog = peewee.ForeignKeyField(Blog)
        
                def __unicode__(self):
                    return '%s: %s' % (self.blog.title, self.title)
        
        
        gotta connect::
        
            >>> from peewee import database
            >>> database.connect()
        
        create some tables::
        
            >>> Blog.create_table()
            >>> Entry.create_table()
        
        
        foreign keys work like django's
        -------------------------------
        
            >>> b = Blog(title="Peewee's Big Adventure")
            >>> b.save()
            >>> e = Entry(title="Greatest movie ever?", content="YES!", blog=b)
            >>> e.save()
            >>> e.blog
            <Blog: Peewee's Big Adventure>
            >>> for e in b.entry_set:
            ...     print e.title
            ...
            Greatest movie ever?
        
        
        querying
        --------
        
        queries come in 4 flavors (select/update/insert/delete).
        
        there's the notion of a *query context* which is the model being selected
        or joined on::
        
            User.select().where(active=True).order_by(('username', 'asc'))
        
        since User is the model being selected, the where clause and the order_by will
        pertain to attributes on the User model.  User is the current query context
        when the .where() and .order_by() are evaluated.
        
        an example using joins::
        
            Tweet.select().where(deleted=False).order_by(('pub_date', 'desc')).join(
                User
            ).where(active=True)
        
        this will select non-deleted tweets from active users.  the first .where() and
        .order_by() occur when Tweet is the current *query context*.  As soon as the
        join is evaluated, User becomes the *query context* and so the following
        where() pertains to the User model.
        
        
        now with q objects
        ------------------
        
        for users familiar with django's orm, I've implemented OR queries and complex
        query nesting using similar notation::
        
            User.select().where(
                Q(is_superuser = True) |
                Q(is_staff = True)
            )
        
            SomeModel.select().where(
                (Q(a='A') | Q(b='B')) &
                (Q(c='C') | Q(d='D'))
            )
        
            # generates something like:
            # SELECT * FROM some_obj
            # WHERE ((a = "A" OR b = "B") AND (c = "C" OR d = "D"))
        
        
        using sqlite
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            import peewee
        
            database = peewee.SqliteDatabase('my.db')
        
            class BaseModel(peewee.Model):
                class Meta:
                    database = database
        
            class Blog(BaseModel):
                creator = peewee.CharField()
                name = peewee.CharField()
        
            class Entry(BaseModel):
                creator = peewee.CharField()
                name = peewee.CharField()
        
        
        using postgresql
        ----------------
        
        you can now use postgresql::
        
            import peewee
        
            database = peewee.PostgresqlDatabase('my_db', user='root')
        
            class BaseModel(peewee.Model):
                class Meta:
                    database = database
        
            # ... same as above sqlite example ...
        
        
        using mysql
        -----------
        
        you can now use MySQL::
        
            import peewee
        
            database = peewee.MySQLDatabase('my_db', user='root')
        
            class BaseModel(peewee.Model):
                class Meta:
                    database = database
        
            # ... same as above sqlite example ...
